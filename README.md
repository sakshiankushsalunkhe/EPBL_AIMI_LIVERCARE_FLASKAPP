# Revolutionizing Liver Care: Predicting Liver Cirrhosis Using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

## Overview
Liver cirrhosis is a progressive disease characterized by liver scarring, often leading to liver failure. Early prediction of cirrhosis can improve patient outcomes by enabling timely medical intervention. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to predict liver cirrhosis based on clinical and laboratory data.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature selection, and normalization.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of multiple ML models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Neural Networks).
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance comparison using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
- **Visualization**: Data exploration through graphs and plots.
- **Deployment**: Integration with a web-based UI or API for real-world usability.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)
- Required libraries (install - visit requirement.txt) 


## Dataset
The dataset contains clinical and laboratory test results, including features such as:

## Usage
### 1. Data Preprocessing
Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare data:

### 2. Train Machine Learning Models
To train and evaluate models:

### 3. Predict Liver Cirrhosis
Use the trained model to make predictions:

## Model Performance
We evaluate the models based on:
- **Accuracy**: Measures correct predictions.
- **Precision & Recall**: Handles class imbalance.
- **AUC-ROC**: Measures overall model performance.

## Deployment
The trained model can be deployed using Flask:

Then, access the API at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Future Work
- Improve feature selection using deep learning.
- Deploy as a cloud-based service.
- Integrate with hospital management systems.
